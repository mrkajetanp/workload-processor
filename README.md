# workload-processor

This project is an automated workload processor designed to be a simplified way of applying analysis provided by [Lisa](https://github.com/ARM-software/lisa) to workloads created by [workload-automation](https://github.com/ARM-software/workload-automation)
It came around as a way of automating my own workflows and so to a large extent it comes as-is and it very likely contains many assumptions about how certain things are done that might not be the case for others.
